## Child's height predictor

This repo contains the Shiny ui.R and server.R scripts for a Child's height predictor app.

This app uses the Galton parent-child height data to fit a linear model to predict the child height. Based on the model fit, this app predicts the height of a child given a new data.

To use this app, you need to enter the parents heights and then choose the child's gender. Click the Calculate button and you will get the result.

Deployed app can be found on:  https://gabybs.shinyapps.io/Developing-Data-Products-CP
